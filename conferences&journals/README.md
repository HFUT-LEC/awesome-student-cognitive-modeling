# Conferences&Journals for AI4ED
In order to establish a clear and systematic organization of conference and journal papers in the field of education, we have classified them into two primary categories: AI and education. This classification principle ensures a more structured and cohesive presentation of relevant papers. By categorizing conferences and journals into these distinct categories, our goal is to facilitate convenient access to educational research and foster a deeper comprehension of the specific domains of AI and education.
