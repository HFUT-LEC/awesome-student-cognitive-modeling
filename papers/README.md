# Awesome Papers on Student Cognitive Modeling
Currently, there is a growing focus on student cognitive modeling, and we have curated articles that cover three essential tasks within this field: cognitive diagnosis, knowledge tracing, and computerized adaptive testing. The purpose of this compilation is to facilitate a rapid comprehension of both historical and future trends in these specific areas.

## Cognitive Diagnosis (CD)
The cognitive diagnostic model is an approach that assesses students' abilities based on factors such as their interaction records and additional information related to exercises. We categorized the papers based on the data and methodology utilized by the Cognitive Diagnosis (CD) model. You can find detailed information from respective subheadings.

## Knowledge Tracing (KT)
Knowledge tracing(KT) involves modeling a student's knowledge over time, enabling us to accurately predict the student's mastery of specific concepts and anticipate their performance in future assessments. KT papers are categorized based on the implemented methods, and specific details can be obtained from the titles of each section below.
