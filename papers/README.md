# Awesome Papers on Student Cognitive Modeling
Currently, there is a growing focus on student cognitive modeling, and we have curated articles that cover three essential tasks within this field: cognitive diagnosis, knowledge tracing, and computerized adaptive testing. The purpose of this compilation is to facilitate a rapid comprehension of both historical and future trends in these specific areas.

## Cognitive Diagnosis (CD)
The cognitive diagnostic model is an approach that assesses students' abilities based on factors such as their interaction records and additional information related to exercises. We categorized the papers based on the data and methodology utilized by the Cognitive Diagnosis (CD) model. You can find detailed information from respective subheadings.

## Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT)
Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is a method that evaluates students' abilities using the CD model and Adaptivsely selects questions for students one by one. Its characteristic is to ensure accurate assessment of student abilities while reducing the length of the test. The existing CAT papers about question selectior can be broadly divided into two categories: one category is non-training-based algorithms, and the other category consists of algorithms where the network of the question selectior requires training, known as learning-based algorithms. "Others" is a category used to include papers that address specific issues in CAT, such as addressing selection bias or improving question search efficiency.
