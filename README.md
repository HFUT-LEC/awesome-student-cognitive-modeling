# Awesome Student Cognitive Modeling
Student cognitive modeling is a fundamental task in intelligence education field. It serves as the basis for educational content recommendation and learning guidance. Cognitive Diagnosis (CD) and Knowledge Tracing (KT) are two mainstream tasks that model studentsâ€™ cognition from static and dynamic perspectives, respectively. 

This repository collects relevant resources about `Student Cognitive Modeling`, which is also an eco-service of [EduStudio](https://github.com/HFUT-LEC/EduStudio) Library!
